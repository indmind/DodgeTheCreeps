# Dodge the Creeps!

this is my first godot game based from http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html tutorial but, without trail particle, because I can't re-create it :cry:

you can try the html5 version of this game here -> https://indmind.github.io/DodgeTheCreeps __This requires support for the recent technologies WebAssembly and WebGL 2.0 in the userâ€™s browser__
